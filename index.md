Hi! I'm Dhruv Sheth, sophomore studying CS at Caltech with focus on learning and vision with a minor in [Robotics](https://mce.caltech.edu/academics/ugrad/robotics_minor).

This past summer, I worked as a research fellow at the Burdick Robotics Lab, where I focused on 6-DoF object tracking with unknown geometry, SDFs, state estimation techniques like GTSAM, uncertainty quantification, and simulation development in MuJoCo and Unity.
 
Previously, I’ve explored embedded machine learning, 3D representations, and computer vision. Lately, my interests have shifted towards learning algorithms in robotics, particularly in dexterous manipulation and multi-finger grasping. What draws me to this niche? Two key reasons:

- Learning why simple tasks for humans such as flipping cubes are so tough for robots.
- There's no silver bullet in the algorithm industry that solves all manipulation problems. This leaves room for exploration.

This term I'll be taking all the classes at school that covers the math and ML behing these algorithms, but the fun way to approch this is implement different policies and see things break - a reason why I love Robotics. Undergraduate robotics is very _MechE_ oriented. No disrespect, I once wanted to be a _MechE_ myself until I realized four more years of thermodynamics wasn’t for me. Coding an algorithm with every edge case meticulously considered, just to make a rover avoid a rock, feels like watching a T. rex try to use a smartphone—technically possible, but painful. We felt there was a start disconnect between current research and undergraduate robotics and the best way to narrow the disconnect is to start a club where people can share ideas, grad students can present research and undergrads take part in manipulation competitions. So this year one of my friends and I started a Robotic Manipulation Club at Caltech to get more people interested in Deep RL, imitation learning and recent efforts in this space.

Outside academics and robotics, I enjoy playing squash, ping pong, Super Smash Bros. and also cycling. I also love painting. I also like reading about philosophy and my favorite reads are about Ouspensky's interactions with Gurdjieff. 

On this website, you can find a summary of my previous work, projects, my resume and some fun stuff.
