# Home

Hi! I'm Dhruv Sheth, sophomore studying CS at Caltech with focus on learning and vision with a minor in [Robotics](https://mce.caltech.edu/academics/ugrad/robotics_minor). My undergraduate advisor is Dr. Soon Jo Chung. 

Previously, Iâ€™ve explored embedded machine learning, 3D representations, and computer vision. Lately, my interests have shifted towards learning side of robotics, particularly in dexterous manipulation and multi-finger grasping.

On this website, you can find a summary of my previous work, projects, my resume and some fun stuff. 

# Recents

- Worked on HiveMind for a hackathon. HiveMind is like Cursor, but better with shared memory. It's an organization-wide knowledge-sharing AI text editor with mixture-of-experts (MoE) orchestration. We use OpenAI Swarms for the MoE orchestration. More information [here](https://github.com/Sam-Fatehmanesh/Cerebral_hive_backend)

- This last summer I was named Dr. Jane Chen Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow at Caltech. I worked on improving the SOTA 6 DOF pose estimation methods and optimizing it for compute constrained environments. I was part of the perception and simulation team of the research. A summary of this work can be found in my SURF presentation: [here](https://dhruvmsheth.github.io/surf-research)
