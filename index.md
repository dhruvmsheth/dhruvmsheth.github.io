# Home

Hi! I'm Dhruv Sheth, sophomore studying CS at Caltech with focus on learning and vision with a minor in [Robotics](https://mce.caltech.edu/academics/ugrad/robotics_minor). My undergraduate advisor is Dr. Soon Jo Chung. 

Previously, Iâ€™ve explored embedded machine learning, 3D representations, and computer vision. Lately, my interests have shifted towards learning algorithms in robotics, particularly in dexterous manipulation and multi-finger grasping.

On this website, you can find a summary of my previous work, projects, my resume and some fun stuff.
