# The Scrawl theme

**Organize documentation, playbooks, and other composition with Scrawl**

Scrawl is a page-centric theme for Jekyll.  Rather catering to posts like most Jekyll themes, Scrawl focuses on providing categorization and navigation for pages.

The Scrawl theme is based on GitHub's [Primer theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer) and the left navigation is inspired by Steve Smith's [Minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal).

## Installation

Set `remote_theme` to `jekyll-theme-scrawl` in your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: jekyll-theme-scrawl
```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here. Describe your available layouts, includes, sass and/or assets.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, fork this repo, clone your fork to your localhost, and run `bundle install`.

The theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser to [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000). As you make changes to your clone of the theme, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When the theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git are bundled.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).
